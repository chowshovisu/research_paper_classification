science,"Automatic text highlighting is capable of becoming a new tool in textual information processing. Preliminary research is done to examine the potential of a new application.for text summarization algorithms. A framework is built for parsing and highlighting PDF files, to which extraction strategies can be applied. Also a small dataset of highlighted documents is gathered to test the highlighting capabilities of our text summarization algorithms on. Thereby, ROUGE-N scores are obtained, the performance per task and the performance per algorithm are evaluated. In the end, the algorithms perform surprisingly well and may encourage more investment in automatic text highlighting."
science,"With the advent of Internet, the data being added online is increasing at enormous rate. Though search engines are using IR techniques to facilitate the search requests from users, the results are not effective towards the search query of the user. The search engine user has to go through certain webpages before getting at the webpage he/she wanted. This problem of Information Overload can be solved using Automatic Text Summarization. Summarization is a process of obtaining at abridged version of documents so that user can have a quick view to understand what exactly the document is about. Email threads from W3C are used in this system. Apart from common IR features like Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency, Term Rank, a variation of page rank based on graph model, which can cluster the words with respective to word ambiguity, is implemented. Term Rank also considers the possibility of co-occurrence of words with the corpus and evaluates the rank of the word accordingly. Sentences of email threads are ranked as per features and summaries are generated. System implemented the concept of pyramid evaluation in content selection. The system can be considered as a framework for Unsupervised Learning in text summarization."
science,"Automatic text summarization is the technique, where a computer is endorsed with the work of summarizing a text. A text is entered into the computer and a summarized text is returned, which is a non redundant extract from the original text. According to Radev et al, a summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts, that conveys important information in the original text (s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s) and usually significantly less than that. In other words, the main goal of a summary is to present the main ideas in a document in less space "
business,"With the flood of data produced by today’s information systems, something must be done to allow business decision-makers to extract the information the data contains. The recent advances in visualization technologies provide the capability to begin to use human visual/spatial abilities to solve the abstract problems found in business. If business problems can be visualized with an appropriate representation, then it may be possible to use innate spatial/visual abilities to allow the business decision-maker to separate the “wheat from the chaff.” This tutorial surveys the issues related to applying visualization technologies to business problem solving."
social science,"This paper introduces the special issue on Social Acceptance of Renewable Energy Innovation. It is a collection of best papers presented at an international research conference held in Tramela(Switzerland) in February 2006. While there are ambitious government targets to increase the share of renewable energy in many countries, it is increasingly recognized that social acceptance may be a constraining factor in achieving this target. This is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy, which has become a subject of contested debates in several countries largely due to its visual impact on landscapes. This paper introduces three dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio-political, community and market acceptance. Factors influencing socio-political and community acceptance are increasingly recognized as being important for understanding the apparent contradictions between general public support for renewable energy innovation and the difficult realization of specific projects. The third dimension, market acceptance, has received less attention so far and provides opportunities for further research, particularly from management scholars."
business,"Nothing has rocked the young field of supply chain management like the emergence of the Internet. While the management of information flows have always been a key aspect of supply chain management, the rapid growth of web-based information transfer between companies, their suppliers, and their customers has decidedly increased the importance of information management in creating effective supply chains. Indeed, the Internet has emerged as a most cost-effective means of driving supply chain integration. We define e-business as the marriage between the Internet and supply chain integration. This marriage is transforming many processes within the supply chain from procurement to customer management and product design."
science,"We develop a method to detect atypical traffic jams in the City of Boston. Our motivation is to detect these traffic jams which are often caused by some event (e.g., accident, lane closure, etc.) and enable the City to intervene before congestion spreads and adjacent roads are negatively affected. Using a traffic jam dataset provided by the City of Boston, we present a novel detection system for anomalous jam identification. We demonstrate its effectiveness by using it to identify traffic jams that cannot be explained by typical traffic patterns."
social science,"This paper considers the practical and intellectual challenges that attend efforts to integrate the social and natural sciences in environmental research,and the broader political, social and economic context in which this takes place. Based on the experiences of researchers in Australia—but with obvious relevance for researchers in many countries—it is the outcome of an interdisciplinary workshop which brought together social and natural scientists involved in environmental management. This event and the wider discussions that followed were initiated to enable researchers to exchange ideas about the obstacles to interdisciplinary collaboration, and to discuss ways to overcome these. The paper provides a summary of the issues and proposes some guidelines for interdisciplinary collaboration."
business,"Many studies found that women-owned firms underperform when comparing performance indicators at an aggregate level. The performance gap might be attributed to gender differences in personal and firm characteristics affecting performance. However, previous studies were not able to entirely explain female underperformance in this way. There are two theoretical perspectives on the causes of female underperformance. Liberal feminist theory suggests that women lack access to relevant resources like education and business experience or financial capital. Social feminist theory suggests that women have different attitudes and values and, consequently, adopt a different approach to business."
science,"In this changing environment the managers and the employees have to rapidly adapt. They have to be opened and prepared for new strategies and to understand the fact that risk and innovation are unavoidable. Organizations cannot compete in this ever-changing environment without proper knowledge and lack of capacity for renewal. Managers have to manage the organization in such a manner that the employees will change their vision, ideas and attitudes on long term. Organizations need to see knowledge management as a strategy, this means knowing how to apply knowledge management (KM) concepts to enhance the performance of the system and processes. The aim of the paper is to identify ways in which companies can develop and support the KM strategy to drive more value, by revising the practices in order to ensure the knowledge focus. The companies are more and more aware about the potential of focusing on learning and training. Among the benefits of approaching knowledge management strategy within organizations we must underline its positive impact on organizational performance, ensuring not only its survival but even providing a competitive advantage."

business,"The concept of business models has reached global impact, both for company's competitive success and in management science. Its application by authors from diverse areas has led to a previously very heterogeneous comprehension of the concept. Yet, by means of investigating its origin and theoretical development, we state a recently converging business model view. Further, based on analyzing business model definitions, perspectives and components in the literature, we newly define the concept and portray its essential components in an integrated framework. Finally, the compilation of the current state of business model research yields the article's main findings. In this regard, via database search we quantitatively identify 681 peer-reviewed articles. Further, we qualitatively analyze them according to individual research areas that we adopt from an appropriate heuristic frame of reference. In this way, we identify four essential research foci: innovation, change & evolution, performance & controlling and design. In triangulation with assessing future research perspectives through a survey of twenty-one international experts, they also consider the areas of innovation, change & evolution, and design to be significant for the future development of the business model research field."
science,"Weather Data Mining is  a form of Data  mining  concerned  with  finding  hidden  patterns  inside largely available meteorological data, so  that the information  retrieved  can  be transformed  into  usable knowledge. In  this  paper we used meteorological data  mining to  analyze wind  speed  behavior. The data  was  recorded  between  2004  to  November 2006  daily historical data by meteorological station of Gaza. After preprocessing the data, we applied  data  mining techniques: association rules, classification, cluster and outlier analysis. From these four tasks, we found  the most appropriate of these techniques  to  be applied  on weather data is  classification  task, especially  the neural networks  method because the nature of the data is time series."
business,"Social media use, potential and challenges in innovation have received little attention in literature, especially from the standpoint of the business-to-business sector. Therefore, this paper focuses on bridging this gap with a survey of social media use, potential and challenges, combined with a social media - focused innovation literature review of state-of-the-art. The study also studies the essential differences between business-to-consumer and business-to-business in the above respects. The paper starts by defining of social media and web 2.0, and then characterizes social media in business, social media in business-to-business sector and social media in business-to-business innovation. Finally we present and analyze the results of our empirical survey of 122 Finnish companies. This paper suggests that there is a significant gap between perceived potential of social media and social media use in innovation activity in business-to-business companies, recognizes potentially effective ways to reduce the gap, and clarifies the found differences between B2B's and B2C's"
social science,"Since 1999 blogs have become a significant feature of online culture. They have been heralded as the new guardians of democracy, a revolutionary form of bottom-up news production and a new way of constructing self and doing community in late-modern times. In this article I highlight the significance of the `blogosphere' as a new addition to the qualitative researcher's toolkit and some of the practical, theoretical and methodological issues that arise from this. Some of the key ethical issues involved in blog data collection are also considered. The research context is a project on everyday understandings and experiences of morality."
science,"Text classification approach gaining more importance because of the accessibility of large number of electronic documents from a variety of resource. Text categorization is the task of assigning predefined categories to documents. It is the method of finding interesting regularities in large textual, where
interesting means non trivial, hidden, previously unknown and potentially useful. The goal of text mining is to enable users to extract information from textual resource and deals with operation such as retrieval, classification, clustering, data mining, natural language preprocessing and machine learning
techniques together to classify different pattern. In text classification, term weighting methods design appropriate weights to the given terms to improve the text classification performance. This paper surveys of text classification, process of text classification different term weighing methods and comparisons between different classification algorithms.

business,"Services are produced and consumed in interaction between service providers and customers. Surprisingly, however, conceptual analyses of buyer-seller interaction have been scarce in service marketing literature. The paper introduces a preliminary conceptualization of buyer-seller interaction in professional business service industries. The framework has its origins in the interaction approach of industrial marketing as well as in social exchange and organization theories. The content of buyer-seller interaction is examined and the evolving bonds and outcomes are identified. Advantages and problems related to the framework are briefly discussed in the end of the paper."
social science,"With over 800 million active users, Facebook is changing the way hundreds of millions of people relate to one another and share information. A rapidly growing body of research has accompanied the meteoric rise of Facebook as social scientists assess the impact of Facebook on social life. In addition, researchers have recognized the utility of Facebook as a novel tool to observe behavior in a naturalistic setting, test hypotheses, and recruit participants. However, research on Facebook emanates from a wide variety of disciplines, with results being published in a broad range of journals and conference proceedings, making it difficult to keep track of various findings. And because Facebook is a relatively recent phenomenon, uncertainty still exists about the most effective ways to do Facebook research. To address these issues, the authors conducted a comprehensive literature search, identifying 412 relevant articles, which were sorted into 5 categories: descriptive analysis of users, motivations for using Facebook, identity presentation, the role of Facebook in social interactions, and privacy and information disclosure. The literature review serves as the foundation from which to assess current findings and offer recommendations to the field for future research on Facebook and online social networks more broadly."
science,"This thesis discusses the state-of heart algorithms, focusing only on those that use machine learning approach, such as neural network based NetSum, or graph representation, such as LexRank. We also present the means of evaluating summaries using ROUGE metrics. A part of the work is experimental implementation of a met hold that takes advantage of frequent patter ns extracted from text. We evaluate and compare the performance of our met hods to traditional methods found in automatic text summarization."
business,"In this article, the authors contribute to the 25th anniversary edition of Family Business Review by gleaning from a coterie of six established scholars insights related to the distinctive nature of family business research, the research designs that emanate from this distinctiveness, and their thoughts related to the direction of the field. While their insights are confirmatory to many who have contributed to the field’s strong current positioning, they serve to highlight to others the rich research opportunities that remain unexplored in the vast family business arena.

social science,"Age and cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory have obvious logical, theoretical, and empirical connections, because both are inherently and irreducibly related to the passage of time. Over the past 15 years, these connections have resulted in the elaboration and application of the cumulative advantage–disadvantage perspective in social gerontology, especially in relation to issues of heterogeneity and inequality. However, its theoretical origins, connections, and implications are not widely understood. This article reviews the genesis of the cumulative advantage/disadvantage perspective in studies of science, its initial articulation with structural-functionalism, and its expanding importance for gerontology. It discusses its intellectual relevance for several other established theoretical paradigms in sociology, psychology, and economics. On the basis of issues deriving from these perspectives and from the accumulating body of work on cumulative advantage and disadvantage, I identify several promising directions for further research in gerontology."
science,This paper presents a new technique for predicting wind speed and direction. This technique is based on using a linear time-series-based model relating the predicted interval to its corresponding one- and two-year old data. The accuracy of the model for predicting wind speeds and directions up to 24 h ahead have been investigate dusingtwosets of data recorded during winter and summer season at Madison weather station. Generated results are compared with their corresponding values when using The persistent model. The presented results validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed prediction model for wind speed and direction.
business," Qualitative research in international business has been rare, the main research streams of the field relying more on quantitative methods. This paper first outlines why qualitative research has been scant. It then presents areas, such as theory building, where qualitative research could make a substantial contribution. Third, it reviews approaches to high standards of qualitative research and criteria for evaluating qualitative research. Finally, some possible research areas where qualitative research might prove fruitful are suggested."
social science,"Laboratory experiments are a widely used methodology for advancing causal knowledge in the physical and life sciences. With the exception of psychology, the adoption of laboratory experiments has been much slower in the social sciences, although during the past two decades the use of lab experiments has accelerated. Nonetheless, there remains considerable resistance among social scientists who argue that lab experiments lack “realism” and generalizability. In this article, we discuss the advantages and limitations of laboratory social science experiments by comparing them to research based on nonexperimental data and to field experiments. We argue that many recent objections against lab experiments are misguided and that even more lab experiments should be conducted."
science,"We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging."
business,"The purpose of this article is to stimulate new ideas for research and guide authors in developing submissions suitable to the scope and vision of the Journal of Family Business Strategy.

In each area, it reviews major contributions, highlights promising areas of inquiry, and presents a set of integrated research questions for further exploration."
social science,"This article calls for a re?conceptualization of the social sciences by asking for a cosmopolitan turn. The intellectual undertaking of redefining cosmopolitanism is a trans?disciplinary one, which includes geography, anthropology, ethnology, international relations, international law, political philosophy and political theory, and now sociology and social theory. Methodological nationalism, which subsumes society under the nation?state, has until now made this task almost impossible. The alternative, a ‘cosmopolitan outlook’, is a contested term and project. Cosmopolitanism must not be equalized with the global (or globalization), with ‘world system theory’ (Wallerstein), with ‘world polity’ (Meyer and others), or with ‘world?society’ (Luhmann). All of those concepts presuppose basic dualisms, such as domestic/foreign or national/international, which in reality have become ambiguous. Methodological cosmopolitanism opens up new horizons by demonstrating how we can make the empirical investigation of border crossings and other transnational phenomena possible."
science,"Most information retrieval systems use stopword lists and stemming algorithms. However, we have found that recognizing singular and plural nouns, verb forms,
negation, and prepositions can produce dramatically different text classification results. We present results from text classification experiments that compare relevancy signatures, which use local linguistic context, with corresponding indexing terms that do not. In two different domains, relevancy signatures produced better results than the simple indexing terms. These experiments suggest that stopword lists and stemming algorithms may remove or conflate many words that could be used to create more effective indexing terms."
business,"This thesis analyzes the effectiveness of food aid received by Ethiopia with a focus on donations from Title II aid from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Ethiopia has faced famine and political issues for many decades and is one of the poorest countries in the world. At the same time, there is a large and growing amount of money going into Ethiopia from the United States in the form of Title II food aid, as well as aid from the World Food Programme, which necessitates an assessment of the effectiveness of this aid. By reviewing quantitative data from government organizations such as the Central Intelligence Agency, USAid, the World Food Programme, and qualitative data from the United Nations, this study assesses the effectiveness of food assistance by USAID and WFP. While a more comprehensive study would be necessary to establish causation, the data and literature reviewed here suggests that increasing food assistance has been associated with improving conditions in Ethiopia, including a decreasing malnutrition rate.

social science,"Conventional ways of viewing the social aspects of entrepreneurship are considered unsatisfactory; hence, this emphasis is recast in terms of the ""entrepreneurial event."" The entrepreneurial event is shaped by groupings of social variables (such as ethnic groups) and the social and cultural environment. The entrepreneurial event is denoted by initiative-taking, consolidation of resources, management, relative autonomy, and risk-taking. The proposed paradigm attempts to include all versions of the entrepreneurial event and all variables (situational, social, and individual) identified with the event. The paradigm will answer two basic questions: what brought about the life-changing event? and why this particular event? Negative information, events, or displacements often lead to entrepreneurial events. The particular action taken depends upon (1) perceptions of desirability (values), and (2) perceptions of feasibility. The utility of the paradigm lies in its application to questions of policy, historical examples, and future research. (TNM)"
science," In order to reduce human efforts, there has been increasing interest in applying active learning for training text classifiers. This paper describes a straightforward active learning heuristic, representative sampling, which explores the clustering structure of ëuncertainí documents and identifies the representative samples to query the user opinions, for the purpose of speeding up the convergence of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Compared with other active learning algorithms, the proposed representative sampling explicitly addresses the problem of selecting more than one unlabeled documents. In an empirical study we compared representative sampling both with random sampling and with SVM active learning. The results demonstrated that representative sampling offers excellent learning performance with fewer labeled documents and thus can reduce human efforts in text classification tasks."

science,"The article examines methodological nationalism, a conceptual tendency that was central to the development of the social sciences and undermined more than a century of migration studies. Methodological nationalism is the naturalization of the global regime of nation?states by the social sciences. Transnational studies, we argue, including the study of transnational migration, is linked to periods of intense globalization such as the turn of the twenty?first century. Yet transnational studies have their own contradictions that may reintroduce methodological nationalism in other guises. In studying migration, the challenge is to avoid both extreme fluidism and the bounds of nationalist thought."
business,"People have turned to the Internet as a method of obtaining music. The craze has stirred up much controversy both in the legal and social realms. The music industry believes that the sharing of music is against the copy write laws, yet people believe that it is their right to share music with others and music will be shared with or without the use of the Internet. Many articles have been written in order to convey the controversy and the legal issues that surround the issue, but this study takes a closer look at the company in the spotlight, Napster, and a new rival, i-Tunes. It continues on to examine how such services became available and the legal battles against Napster as well as individuals for using such methods of gathering music. Moreover, it answers the question of whether people are still using free download sites, the consequences of using such sites, and finally, whether Napster and i-Tunes have discovered a successful new business."
social science,"Some ideas have dramatically more impact than others – they may overturn existing paradigms or launch new areas of scientific inquiry. Where do such high impact ideas come from? Are some search processes significantly more likely to lead to breakthrough idea generation than others? In this research, we compare “high impact” papers from the social sciences with random-but-matched articles published in the same journals in the same years. We find that search scope, search depth, and atypical connections between different research domains significantly increase a paper's impact, even when controlling for the experience and prior publishing success of the author(s)."
science,"This paper presents the methodology of Textual Content Classification, which is based on a combination of algorithms: preliminary formation of a contextual framework for the texts in particular problem area; manual creation of the Hierarchical Sentiment Dictionary (HSD) on the basis of a topically-oriented Corpus; tonality texts recognition via using HSD for analysing the documents as a collection of topically completed fragments (paragraphs). For verification of the proposed methodology, a case study of Polish-language film reviews Corpora was used. The main scientific contributions of this research are: writing style of the analyzed text determines the possibility of adaptation of the Texts Classification algorithms; Hierarchically-oriented Structure of the HSD allows customizing the classification process to qualitative recognition of text tonality in the context of individual paragraphs topics; texts of Persuasive style most often are initially empowered by authors with a certain tonality. The tone, expressed in the author's opinion, effects the qualitative indicators of sentiment recognition. Negative emotions of the author usually reduce the level of vocabulary variability as well as the variety of topics raised in the document but simultaneously increase the level of unpredictability of words contextually used with both positive and negative emotional coloring"
business,"Fidelity Investments is regarded as the leader in the financial services industry. They have managed to do this by remaining one of the most technologically advanced companies around as well as being extremely innovative. Fidelity Investments deals in outsourcing, which means Fidelity manages other companies’ payroll, retirement plans, benefits, etc. so that the other companies do not need to form an independent department to handle these issues. When a larger company wishes to have Fidelity manage these issues it is handled by the Large Plan Services segment. This presentation examines the current problems that occur from the way information is currently distributed amongst the segment’s Project Managers and cliental. It will offer answers to the problems that currently slow the flow of information throughout the segment and help make the system more efficient.

Based on the experiences of researchers in Australia—but with obvious relevance for researchers in many countries—it is the outcome of an interdisciplinary workshop which brought together social and natural scientists involved in environmental management. This event and the wider discussions that followed were initiated to enable researchers to exchange ideas about the obstacles to interdisciplinary collaboration, and to discuss ways to overcome these. The paper provides a summary of the issues and proposes some guidelines for interdisciplinary collaboration. "
science,"Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) beat classification is essential to timely diagnosis of dangerous heart conditions. Specifically, accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is imperative to prepare for the possible onset of life-threatening arrhythmias. Although many groups have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting PVC beats, results have generally been limited to relatively small data sets. Additionally, many of the highest classification accuracies (>90%) have been achieved in experiments where training and testing sets overlapped significantly. Expanding the overall data set greatly reduces overall accuracy due to significant variation in ECG morphology among different patients. As a result, we believe that morphological information must be coupled with timing information, which is more constant among patients, in order to achieve high classification accuracy for larger data sets. With this approach, we combined wavelet-transformed ECG waves with timing information as our feature set for classification. We used select waveforms of 18 files of the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, which provides an annotated collection of normal and arrhythmic beats, for training our neural-network classifier. We then tested the classifier on these 18 training files as well as 22 other files from the database."
business,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between awareness of autism in the general public and availability of funding for autism research. Researchers have found no source of autism in children and due to this they have also not been able to find a cure. Children are being diagnosed with autism at incredibly high rates; much higher than any other disability that afflicts children, yet it receives the least public and private funding of all of these same disabilities. There have been many steps taken recently by the government and by private institutions to increase awareness and the availability of funds for programs to help children with autism and also research to find the source and a cure for autism. This paper seeks to find the connection between awareness and availability of funding and also to identify steps that can be taken to increase both.

social science,"The second edition of this guide to Adam Smith's system of thought has been fully updated to reflect recent developments in Smith scholarship and Professor Skinner's experience of teaching Smith to a student audience. The material from the first edition has been extensively rewritten, and four new chapters have been added, covering Smith's essays on the exercise of human understanding, and his relationship to Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, and Sir James Steuart. Professor Skinner places Smith's system of social, and moral, science firmly within the context of contemporary British and Continental intellectual history, dealing in particular detail with the founders of the Scottish Enlightenment and with the French Physiocrats. A close reading of a broad range of texts, supported by a deep knowledge of contemporary institutional history, suggests the patters of their influence through the various recensions of Smith's extant works. The essays similarly explore Smith's own reception among his peers and successors. The essays in this volume have been developed from Professor Skinner's lecture course on `The Age and Ideas of Adam Smith', taught to senior undergraduate and graduate students in political economy. Their relevance extends out to students of economic history, philosophy, and the history of ideas in the eighteenth century, as well as to all those involved in the study of Adam Smith. Each essay can be read as a self-contained unit, supported by a full bibliography and notes; the book as a whole expounds a single coherent argument which demonstrates how Smith's works are inter-related."
science,"We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 39.7\% and 18.9\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art results. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and two globally connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of convolutional nets. To reduce overfitting in the globally connected layers we employed a new regularization method that proved to be very effective."
business,"The global financial crisis that began in 2007 is considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. During this global financial meltdown the world has witnessed disastrous stock market crashes, the implosion of multiple prestigious financial institutions, and government bailouts on an unprecedented scale. Surprisingly, it is difficult to receive a straightforward explanation from the financial sector or the government regarding the causes of this financial meltdown and the lack of foresight from both private and public entities. The view expressed in this paper is that both the private sector and the government are to blame for the magnitude of the financial crisis and for the lack of accountability in the steps taken in the aftermath of the global meltdown. To support this contention, this paper will draw upon interviews conducted with individuals in the banking and investment sector, primary sources dealing with the financial crisis, and the analysis of experts in the field. This paper will concentrate on assessing the root causes of the crisis, providing a summary of the key events, evaluating both the private financial sector and government’s role in the crisis, and analyzing the current business environment. The turbulence in the financial system has affected citizens in every income bracket and field of work and we all have a vested interest in understanding the causes and consequences of these pivotal events. George Santayana famously stated that “those who cannot remember their past are condemned to repeat it”, and it is the goal of this paper to ensure not only that we remember our past, but that we understand it.

social science,"The replacement of appliances and other energy using products by more efficient ones is generally regarded as an effective strategy to reduce energy demand. However, the savings realized by this strategy may be lower than those theoretically expected or calculated from a technological point of view due to changes of behaviour following the acquisition. This phenomenon is known as the rebound effect. While scientists generally agree on the existence of rebound effects, size, relevance and explanations of such effects are controversially discussed. This paper discusses concepts to explain rebound effects from a psychological as well as sociological point of view. In particular, an approach which combines variables from psychological action theories with the sociological life-style concept is suggested as a framework for studying determinants of rebound effects."
science,"By replacing the sigmoid activation function often used in neural networks with an exponential function, a probabilistic neural network (PNN) that can compute nonlinear decision boundaries which approach the Bayes optimal is formed. Alternate activation functions having similar properties are also discussed. A fourlayer neural network of the type proposed can map any input pattern to any number of classifications. The decision boundaries can be modified in real-time using new data as they become available, and can be implemented using artificial hardware “neurons” that operate entirely in parallel. Provision is also made for estimating the probability and reliability of a classification as well as making the decision. The technique offers a tremendous speed advantage for problems in which the incremental adaptation time of back propagation is a significant fraction of the total computation time. For one application, the PNN paradigm was 200,000 times faster than back-propagation."
business,"In the late 1800’s the Hannaford brothers, led by their sibling Arthur opened a small fresh produce market. From there the Hannaford brothers turned a small produce market into one of the most prominent grocery stores in the New England region. The grocery industry is by no means a non-competitive industry. With the emergence of companies like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Wal-Mart, and E-Commerce grocery, Hannaford needs a plan to stay on top of the grocery industry. Using research from websites, journals, and books, a case study was completed that contains a history of Hannaford Brothers and its major competitors, an analysis of their strengths, and finally recommendations of what Hannaford can do to stay on top. Hannaford has achieved a good position in the grocery industry as one in which customer service and high quality is a necessity. With their merger with Delhaize of America they have the financial backing of one of the largest food retailers in the United States. Hannaford has the unique opportunity to further develop themselves as one of the leaders in the industry while continuing to offer low prices, and venturing into new markets. Given all this Hannaford can remain among the top leaders in the grocery industry for the future.

social science,"A growing body of evidence supports the contention of scholarly culture theory that immersing children in book-oriented environments benefits their later educational achievement, attainment and occupational standing. These findings have been interpreted as suggesting that book-oriented socialization, indicated by home library size, equips youth with life-long tastes, skills and knowledge. However, to date, this has not been directly assessed. Here, we document advantageous effects of scholarly culture for adult literacy, adult numeracy, and adult technological problem solving. Growing up with home libraries boosts adult skills in these areas beyond the benefits accrued from parental education or own educational or occupational attainment. The effects are loglinear, with greatest returns to the growth in smaller libraries. Our evidence comes from regressions with balanced repeated replicate weights estimated on data from 31 societies which participated in the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) between 2011 and 2015."
science,"In this paper, we propose a sequential learning algorithm for a neural network classifier based on human meta-cognitive learning principles. The network, referred to as Meta-cognitive Neural Network (McNN). McNN has two components, namely the cognitive component and the meta-cognitive component. A radial basis function network is the fundamental building block of the cognitive component. The meta-cognitive component controls the learning process in the cognitive component by deciding what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn. When a sample is presented at the cognitive component of McNN, the meta-cognitive component chooses the best learning strategy for the sample using estimated class label, maximum hinge error, confidence of classifier and class-wise significance. Also sample overlapping conditions are considered in growth strategy for proper initialization of new hidden neurons. The performance of McNN classifier is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository and two practical problems, viz., the acoustic emission for signal classification and a mammogram data set for cancer classification."
business,"The goal of this project was to establish a one to three year expansion plan for the Ja’Duke Center for the Performing Arts (JCPA). JCPA is a family owned corporation established in 2004 and is currently looking for ways to expand their company. Using case study research and presentation methods, various recommendations can be made of how to go about the expansion. Case Study method begins by researching the history of the corporation, which then aids in developing pertinent facts about the business. Then S.W.O.T. analysis is performed which focuses on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the company. Finally, from the facts and S.W.O.T. analysis recommendations are made in order to solve the problem of how to successfully expand the company in a one to three year time span. This case study focuses on recommendations based on the Management by Objectives theory developed by Peter Drucker. This means that the recommendations are made based on specific goals rather than different areas of business. Some of the goals include: increasing enrollment at the center by 20% each year, designing and building a 8,000 square foot facility, increasing staffing by 2 part-time employees per year, diversifying revenue by adding programs, and finally finding affordable health insurance for owners and employees.

social science,"Unlike traditional research on educational stratification that focuses on the pursuit of higher education, our study examines why young adults do not make the transition to college, using a nationally representative sample of college non-enrollees (N = 2640). In applying latent class analysis techniques, we identified multiple types of students who do not pursue college. One group of non-enrollees (27.6%) reports forgoing college because the economic barriers are too high – either because of college affordability or family financial responsibility. These youth had both low math test scores and low family income, and thus closely align with regression-based analyses on college enrollment that emphasize academic and economic constraints as the central barriers to educational progress. However, we also identified a second, often overlooked group of youth who had the academic preparation and family income support to enroll in higher education, but decided to forgo college because they preferred to work and to make money (18.3%). The heterogeneous motives of these youth suggest that postsecondary decisions are not always guided by academic and economic barriers, but sometimes driven by previous work experience and perceptions of local opportunities for school and work."
science,A four layer fuzzy neural network is presented to realise knowledge acquisition from input-output samples. The network parameters including the necessary membership functions of the input variables and the consequent parameters are tuned and identified using a modified particle swarm algorithm which uses each particle's best current performance of its neighbours to replace the best previous one and uses a non accumulative rate of change to replace the accumulative one for accelerating search procedure. The trained network is then pruned so that the general rules can be extracted and explained. The experimental results have shown that the similar classification rules can be obtained in comparison to that of other fuzzy neural approaches.
business,"This work grew from initiatives of the International Society of Biometeorology's Commission on Climate, Tourism and Recreation (ISBCCTR). The ISBCCTR was formed during the 15th Congress of the ISB held in November 1999 in Sydney, Australia. The aim of ISBCCTR is to promote research in tourism climatology. The first formal meeting of the Commission took place at the Meliton Resort, Halkidiki, Greece, 5–10 October 2001. The aims were to (1) bring together a selection of scientists and tourism experts to review the current state of knowledge of tourism climatology and (2) explore areas and priorities for future work and the role of the Commission in this. The Workshop highlighted the fact that, although climate is widely recognised as vitally important to tourism, relatively little is known about its effects. Even less is known about the economic impact or significance of climate on commercial prospects for tourism. Important research themes that warrant attention were identified. Among these was the need for a tourism climate index (or indices) that integrates all facets of climate, uses standard data and is objectively tested and verified. Work is also required on developing a better understanding of what climate-related information is required by both tourists and the tourism industry, exploring the distinction between the impact of climate on tourists and the impact on the tourism industry, setting a standard approach to tourism climate assessment, assessing the role of weather forecasts and long-term expectations of climate on choices made by tourists, the risks to tourism caused by extreme atmospheric events, what climate-related criteria people use to make decisions about tourism and recreational choices, how products giving information about weather and climate are currently used by the recreation and tourism industry and what are the existing and future requirements for this climate information.

social science,"Violent video games have been the subject of much news and analysis. One area of the debate, particularly in legal arenas, has been whether parents have or should have control over what games their children play. Despite such debates, only limited empirical research has examined whether parents actually do have influence over what games their children play or how much they play them. Using cross-sectional data from large-samples of American high-school and middle-school students, this study examines parental influences on violent video game play and the role of perceived parental opinion of violent video games. Results suggest that parental attachment and perceived parental opinion of video games play a significant role in the degree to which youth play violent games, even through later adolescence in high school."
science,"Mammography associated with clinical breast examination and breast self-examination is the only effective and viable method for mass breast screening. Most of the minimal breast cancers are detected by the presence of microcalcifications. It is however difficult to distinguish between benign and malignant microcalcifications associated with breast cancer. Most of the techniques used in the computerized analysis of mammographic microcalcifications segment the digitized grey-level image into regions representing microcalcifications. Since mammographic images usually suffer from poorly defined microcalcification features, the extraction of microcalcification features based on segmentation process is not reliable and accurate. We present a second-order grey-level histogram based feature extraction approach which does not require the segmentation of microcalcifications into binary regions to extract features to be used in classification. The image structure features, computed from the second-order grey-level histogram statistics, are used for classification of microcalcifications. Several image structure features were computed for 100 cases of “difficult to diagnose” microcalcification cases with known biopsy results. These features were analyzed in a correlation study which provided a set of five best image structure features. A feedforward backpropagation neural network was used to classify mammographic microcalcifications using the image structure features. Four networks were trained for different combinations of training and test cases, and number of nodes in hidden layers. False Positive (FP) and True Positive (TP) rates for microcalcification classification were computed to compare the performance of the trained networks. The results of the neural network based classification were compared with those obtained using multivariate Baye’s classifiers, and the k-nearest neighbor classifier. "

social science,"We examine how religious and political factors structure support for same-sex marriage in the United States over the last two decades. Using data from the General Social Surveys, we show that respondents who identify more strongly with the Republican Party, sectarian denominations, and those who subscribe to biblical fundamentalism and political conservatism are substantially more opposed to same-sex marriage than are other Americans. Heterogeneous ordinal logistic regression models show that these religious and political factors have become more important over the last two decades. Cohorts born after 1945 became substantially more supportive of marriage rights between 1988 and 2008, but shifts in support for marriage rights were less sizeable for persons affiliated with sectarian denominations, religious fundamentalists, Republicans, and political conservatives. Estimates from structural equation models show that religious factors influence political conservatism and Republican identification, yet both religious and political factors have significant and substantial independent direct effects on support for same-sex marriage."
science,"Neural network learning procedures and statistical classificaiton methods are applied and compared empirically in classification of multisource remote sensing and geographic data. Statistical multisource classification by means of a method based on Bayesian classification theory is also investigated and modified. The modifications permit control of the influence of the data sources involved in the classification process. Reliability measures are introduced to rank the quality of the data sources. The data sources are then weighted according to these rankings in the statistical multisource classification. Four data sources are used in experiments: Landsat MSS data and three forms of topographic data (elevation, slope, and aspect). Experimental results show that two different approaches have unique advantages and disadvantages in this classification application."
business,"The second edition of this book contains new updated material and added case studies illustrating the response of business and other organizations to environmental problems. The first section (4 chapters) provides background material related to ecology, environmental ethics, regulation and public policy of environmental management. The second section (7 chapters) discusses specific environmental issues such as global warming, ozone depletion, air and water pollution, use of pesticides, control of toxic substances, hazardous waste disposal, effects of deforestation, coastal erosion, and wetlands protection. All chapters link the issues to managerial practice. The third section (3 chapters) focuses on problems apparent in traditional approaches with respect to the natural environment, presents work that attempts to integrate the natural environment into theoretical aspects of management, addresses issues of manufacturing, marketing, strategies and communication and outlines strategies for the whole society related to sustainable development."
social science,"In 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued an official brief on lesbian and gay parenting. This brief included the assertion: “Not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents” (p. 15). The present article closely examines this assertion and the 59 published studies cited by the APA to support it. Seven central questions address: (1) homogeneous sampling, (2) absence of comparison groups, (3) comparison group characteristics, (4) contradictory data, (5) the limited scope of children’s outcomes studied, (6) paucity of long-term outcome data, and (7) lack of APA-urged statistical power. The conclusion is that strong assertions, including those made by the APA, were not empirically warranted. Recommendations for future research are offered."
science,"We propose two efficient approximations to standard convolutional neural networks: Binary-Weight-Networks and XNOR-Networks. In Binary-Weight-Networks, the filters are approximated with binary values resulting in 32× memory saving. In XNOR-Networks, both the filters and the input to convolutional layers are binary. XNOR-Networks approximate convolutions using primarily binary operations. This results in 58× faster convolutional operations (in terms of number of the high precision operations) and 32× memory savings. XNOR-Nets offer the possibility of running state-of-the-art networks on CPUs (rather than GPUs) in real-time. Our binary networks are simple, accurate, efficient, and work on challenging visual tasks. We evaluate our approach on the ImageNet classification task. The classification accuracy with a Binary-Weight-Network version of AlexNet is the same as the full-precision AlexNet. We compare our method with recent network binarization methods, BinaryConnect and BinaryNets, and outperform these methods by large margins on ImageNet, more than 16% in top-1 accuracy."
business,"In his presentation at the 1993 Society of Business Ethics conference, Ed Freeman offered a provocative explanation for why the normative core of business and society (B&S) research is perceived as fundamentally at odds with the pervasive wisdom on business and the academic literature on management (e.g., ""business ethics is an oxymoron""). He termed this explanation the separation thesis. This article explores the possibility that the separation thesis captures a pervasively held view about corporations, even among B &S researchers. To support this claim, the author looks at whether three value dichotomies, which provide the conceptual underpinnings of the separation thesis, are prevalent in the literature. The article provides evidence from the literatures in ethics, corporate social responsibility/ performance, and wider management issues to support its claims, and then looks at alternative possibilities for developing inquiry to avoid the pitfalls of these value dichotomies and, therefore, the separation thesis.

social science,"Despite popular commentary claiming a link between immigration and crime, empirical research exploring this relationship is sparse. Especially missing from the literature on immigration and crime is a consideration of how immigration affects rates of crime at the macro-level. Although individual-level studies of immigrant criminality and victimization tend to demonstrate that immigrants typically engage in less crime than their native-born counterparts, the effect of immigration on aggregate criminal offending is less clear. In this research, we attempt to address this weakness in the literature by examining the effects of aspects of immigration on crime rates in metropolitan areas. We combine 2000 US Census data and 2000 Uniform Crime Report data to explore how the foreign-born population influences criminal offending across a sample of metropolitan areas. After controlling for a host of demographic and economic characteristics, we find that immigration does not increase crime rates, and some aspects of immigration lessen crime in metropolitan areas."
science,"It can be shown that by replacing the sigmoid activation function often used in neural networks with an exponential function, a neural network can be formed which computes nonlinear decision boundaries. This technique yields decision surfaces which approach the Bayes optimal under certain conditions. There is a continuous control of the linearity of the decision boundaries, from linear for small training sets to any degree of nonlinearity justified by larger training sets. A four-layer neural network of the type proposed can map any input pattern to any number of classifications. The input variables can be either continuous or binary. Modification of the decision boundaries based on new data can be accomplished in real time simply by defining a set of weights equal to the new training vector. The decision boundaries can be implemented using analog 'neurons', which operate entirely in parallel. The organization proposed takes into account the projected pin limitations of neural-net chips of the near future."

social science,"Is wealthier always healthier, or are the health effects of economic growth trivial, irregular, or perhaps even detrimental? Using data for up to 134 developing countries between 1970 and 2015, this article revisits the effect of economic growth on health, focusing on infant mortality, life expectancy, and caloric consumption. The analysis enlarges the geographical and temporal scope of previous samples and attempts to isolate the causal effects of growth using two-stage models with instrumental variables. Results show that five-year economic growth rates improve all three health outcomes, even after controlling for other important determinants and accounting for the possibility of reverse causality. Growth effects are largest for infant mortality rates. Nevertheless, there are diminishing returns to economic growth as a function of economic development: as countries become more affluent, the benefits of growth for health diminish.

science,"Spatial features of hyperspectral imagery (HSI) have gained an increasing attention in the latest years. Considering deep convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract a hierarchy of increasingly spatial features, this paper proposes an HSI reconstruction model based on deep CNN to enhance spatial features. The framework proposes a new spatial features-based strategy for band selection to define training label with rich information for the first time. Then, hyperspectral data is trained by deep CNN to build a model with optimized parameters which is suitable for HSI reconstruction. Finally, the reconstructed image is classified by the efficient extreme learning machine (ELM) with a very simple structure. Experimental results indicate that framework built based on CNN and ELM provides competitive performance with small number of training samples. Specifically, by using the reconstructed image, the average accuracy of ELM can be improved as high as 30.04%, while performs tens to hundreds of times faster than those state-of-the-art classifiers."
business,"Online consumer groups represent a large pool of product know-how. Hence, they seem to be a promising source of innovation. At present, except for open source software, little is known about how to utilize this know-how for new product development. In this article we explore if and how members of virtual communities can be integrated into new product development. We explain how to identify and access online communities and how to interact with its members in order to get valuable input for new product development. This approach we term “Community Based Innovation.” The Audi case illustrates the applicability of the method and underscores the innovative capability of consumers encountered in virtual communities.

social science,"This paper examines the extent to which the black-white gap in happiness—an important indicator of subjective well-being—has narrowed over the 1972 to 2014 period. Analyzing data from the General Social Survey, we find that that the difference in levels of happiness between whites and blacks is substantial, but declined over time. Results from a decomposition analysis shed new light on the sources of change. We find that observable differences in characteristics of whites and blacks explain a significant and growing proportion of the happiness gap. The two most important characteristics are income and marital status, as both are strongly associated with race and happiness, and the proportion of the difference in the gap that they explain has generally increased over time. Overall, the declining gap in happiness is consistent with the moderate narrowing of substantial racial disparities in other realms, such as life expectancy, residential segregation, and neighborhood conditions, suggesting small steps toward equality in some realms, even as high levels of inequality persist in others."
science,"In this paper, we present bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a modified, full gradient version of the LSTM learning algorithm. We evaluate Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) and several other network architectures on the benchmark task of framewise phoneme classification, using the TIMIT database. Our main findings are that bidirectional networks outperform unidirectional ones, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is much faster and also more accurate than both standard Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) and time-windowed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results support the view that contextual information is crucial to speech processing, and suggest that BLSTM is an effective architecture with which to exploit it.1"
business,"We investigate the problem of ranking all process models in a repository according to their similarity with respect to a given process model. We focus specifically on the application of graph matching algorithms to this similarity search problem. Since the corresponding graph matching problem is NP-complete, we seek to find a compromise between computational complexity and quality of the computed ranking. Using a repository of 100 process models, we evaluate four graph matching algorithms, ranging from a greedy one to a relatively exhaustive one. The results show that the mean average precision obtained by a fast greedy algorithm is close to that obtained with the most exhaustive algorithm.

social science,"This article highlights an important yet insufficiently understood international-level determinant of inequality in the developing world: structural adjustment programs by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Studying a panel of 135 countries for the period 1980 to 2014, we examine income inequality using multivariate regression analysis corrected for non-random selection into both IMF programs and associated policy reforms (known as ‘conditionality’). We find that, overall, policy reforms mandated by the IMF increase income inequality in borrowing countries. We also test specific pathways linking IMF programs to inequality by disaggregating conditionality by issue area. Our analyses indicate adverse distributional consequences for four policy areas: fiscal policy reforms that restrain government expenditure, external sector reforms stipulating trade and capital account liberalization, financial sector reforms entailing inflation-control measures, and reforms that restrict external debt. These effects occur one year after the incidence of an IMF program, and persist in the medium term. Taken together, our findings suggest that the IMF's recent attention to inequality neglects the multiple ways through which the organization's own policy advice has contributed to inequality in the developing world."

business,"This study investigates the possible funding gap for women–owned compared with men–owned new businesses. With longitudinal data from new businesses in Norway, gender differences in funding perceptions and behaviors, as well as in actually obtained amounts of funding, are explored. While there are few detected gender differences with respect to funding perceptions and behavior, women obtain significantly less financial capital to develop their new businesses. Moreover, the results indicate that the lower levels of financial capital that women business founders achieve are associated with lower early business growth compared with their male counterparts.

social science,"Since the late 1990s public opinion about cannabis legalization has become drastically more liberal, and some states have begun to legalize cannabis for recreational use. Why have attitudes changed so much? Prior research has considered a few of the reasons for this change, but this is the first comprehensive and empirically-based study to consider the wide range of potential causes for how and why this happened. We use data from the General Social Survey, National Study of Drug Use and Health, and word searches from the New York Times. We find that attitudes largely liberalized via intracohort changes. Most Americans developed more liberal views, regardless of their race and ethnicity, gender, education, religious or political affiliation, or religious engagement. Changes in cannabis use have had minimal effects on attitudes, and legalization of cannabis has not prompted attitude change in neighboring states. As to root causes, evidence suggests that a decrease in religious affiliation, a decline in punitiveness, and a shift in media framing all contributed to changing attitudes."
science,"We describe the approach that won the final phase of the German traffic sign recognition benchmark. Our method is the only one that achieved a better-than-human recognition rate of 99.46%. We use a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that does not require careful design of pre-wired feature extractors, which are rather learned in a supervised way. Combining various DNNs trained on differently preprocessed data into a Multi-Column DNN (MCDNN) further boosts recognition performance, making the system insensitive also to variations in contrast and illumination."

social science,"Immigrants and ethnic minorities tend to have lower life satisfaction than majority populations. However, current understanding of the drivers of these gaps is limited. Using a rich, nationally representative data set with a large sample of ethnic minorities and matched neighbourhood characteristics, we test whether first and second generation minorities experience lower life satisfaction once accounting for compositional differences and whether, specifically, neighbourhood deprivation impacts their wellbeing. We further investigate whether a larger proportion of own ethnic group in the neighbourhood improves satisfaction. We find life satisfaction is lower among ethnic minorities, and especially for the second generation, even controlling for individual and area characteristics. Neighbourhood concentration of own ethnic group is, however, associated with higher life satisfaction for Black Africans and UK born Indians and Pakistanis. The effect for Black Africans may stem from selection into areas, but findings for Indians and Pakistanis are robust to sensitivity tests."
science,"This paper presents the usage of an artificial neural network, Kohonen’s self organizing feature map, for visualisation and classification of high dimensional data. Through a learning process, this neural network creates a mapping from a N-dimensional space to a two-dimensional plane of units (neurons). This mapping is known to preserve topological relations of the N-dimensional space. A specially developed technique, called U-matrix method has been developed in order to detect nonlinearities in the resulting mapping. This method can be used to visualize structures of the N-dimensional space. Boundaries between different subsets of input data can be detectet. This allows to use this method for a clustering of the data. New data can be classified in an associative way. It has been demonstrated, that the method can be used also for knowledge acquisition and exploratory data analysis purposes."
business,"Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) is often mentioned as an antecedent of growth, competitive advantage and superior performance, and prior empirical research has often shown a positive relationship between EO and performance appears to exist. However, an important question that remains unanswered is what effect EO might have on firm performance during periods of economic crisis, and the severe environmental turbulence that accompany such crises. This research is a first investigation towards the effects of EO on the performance of small and medium sized firms during the current global economic crisis. In this study we use the multidimensional model of EO and test a series of hypotheses pertaining to its performance effects using survey data gathered from 164 Dutch SMEs. The present research shows that proactive firm behavior positively contributes to SME performance during the economic crisis. We further show that innovative SMEs do perform better in turbulent environments, but those innovative SMEs should minimize the level of risk and should take action to avoid projects that are too risky.

social science,"Although many studies have examined associations between family structure and children’s educational achievement at the individual level, few studies have considered how the increase in single-parent households may have affected children’s educational achievement at the population level. We examined changes in the percentage of children living with single parents between 1990 and 2011 and state mathematics and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Regression models with state and year fixed effects revealed that changes in the percentage of children living with single parents were not associated with test scores. Increases in maternal education, however, were associated with improvements in children’s test scores during this period. These results do not support the notion that increases in single parenthood have had serious consequences for U.S. children’s school achievement."
science," We present a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of Convolutional Neural Network variants. Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed nor pre-wired, but rather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical architectures achieve the best published results on benchmarks for object classification (NORB, CIFAR10) and handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), with error rates of 2.53%, 19.51%, 0.35%, respectively. Deep nets trained by simple back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs. Test error rates on MNIST drop to 2.42%, 0.97% and 0.48% after 1, 3 and 17 epochs, respectively.

business,"Switching from the current linear model of economy to a circular one has recently attracted increased attention from major global companies e.g., Google, Unilever, Renault, and policymakers attending the World Economic Forum. The reasons for this are the huge financial, social and environmental benefits. However, the global shift from one model of economy to another also concerns smaller companies on a micro-level. Thus, comprehensive knowledge on designing circular business models is needed to stimulate and foster implementation of the circular economy. Existing business models for the circular economy have limited transferability and there is no comprehensive framework supporting every kind of company in designing a circular business model. This study employs a literature review to identify and classify the circular economy characteristics according to a business model structure. The investigation in the eight sub-domains of research on circular business models was used to redefine the components of the business model canvas in the context of the circular economy. Two new components—the take-back system and adoption factors—have been identified, thereby leading to the conceptualization of an extended framework for the circular business model canvas. Additionally, the triple fit challenge has been recognized as an enabler of the transition towards a circular business model. Some directions for further research have been outlined, as well.

social science,"The New Family Structures Study (NFSS) is a social-science data-collection project that fielded a survey to a large, random sample of American young adults (ages 18–39) who were raised in different types of family arrangements. In this debut article of the NFSS, I compare how the young-adult children of a parent who has had a same-sex romantic relationship fare on 40 different social, emotional, and relational outcome variables when compared with six other family-of-origin types. The results reveal numerous, consistent differences, especially between the children of women who have had a lesbian relationship and those with still-married (heterosexual) biological parents. The results are typically robust in multivariate contexts as well, suggesting far greater diversity in lesbian-parent household experiences than convenience-sample studies of lesbian families have revealed. The NFSS proves to be an illuminating, versatile dataset that can assist family scholars in understanding the long reach of family structure and transitions."
science,"Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data. In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN."
business,"This editorial suggests moving beyond relying on the dominant logic of multiple regression analysis (MRA) toward thinking and using algorithms in advancing and testing theory in accounting, consumer research, finance, management, and marketing. The editorial includes an example of testing an MRA model for fit and predictive validity. The same data used for the MRA is used to conduct a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The editorial reviews a number of insights by prominent scholars including Gerd Gigerenzer's treatise that “Scientists' tools are not neutral.” Tools impact thinking and theory crafting as well theory testing. The discussion may be helpful for early career scholars unfamiliar with David C. McClelland's brilliance in data analysis and in introducing business research scholars to fsQCA as an alternative tool for theory development and data analysis.

social science,"Annette Lareau coined the term “concerted cultivation” to describe the cultural logic of a distinctive middle-class parenting pattern. I explore whether concerted cultivation as practiced in Japan exhibits unique patterns in response to distinctive characteristics of the nation's education system (i.e., standardized compulsory education with high-stakes educational selection in secondary education). Using nationally representative longitudinal data on third-to sixth-grade children (N?=?30187) through growth curve models, I show that college educated parents shift their focus of parenting practices (measured by four aspects) from providing diverse experiences to narrower academic preparation as the time for lower secondary education approaches. Using multivariate analyses with an additional wave of data in seventh grade, I further demonstrate that “unequal childhoods,”––the accumulated disparities in adult-led structured experiences––lead to unequal success in the transition to junior high school education, a critical period of preparation before the mass educational selection (i.e., high school admissions)."
science,"The authors report the application of three-layer back-propagation networks for classification of Landsat TM data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The results are compared to Gaussian maximum likelihood classification. First, it is shown that the neural network is able to perform better than the maximum likelihood classifier. Secondly, in an extension of the basic network architecture it is shown that textural information can be integrated into the neural network classifier without the explicit definition of a texture measure. Finally, the use of neural networks for postclassification smoothing is examined"
business,"The innovation-driven multinational enterprise (MNE) has dominated international business (IB) research for several decades now. Beginning with the award-winning research of Dunning, there have been calls for IB researchers to rediscover the importance of locations. Recent work has emphasized that firms and locations co-evolve with one another, as knowledge is transferred and leveraged across space. Integrating insights from IB and economic geography, we propose a research agenda for IB scholarship on spatially dispersed yet connected innovation processes. This agenda is premised on the current reality of global value chains in which mobile (MNEs, people) and immobile (locations) factors interact. The research perspective suggested recognizes that locations are host to increasingly “fine-sliced” activities, whose nature and composition are continuously changed by MNE-driven innovation processes. As today’s specialized activities become tomorrow’s standardized ones, the shifting distribution of global value creation depends on the pattern of international knowledge connectivity.

social science,"The term big data is currently a buzzword in social science, however its precise meaning is ambiguous. In this paper we focus on administrative data which is a distinctive form of big data. Exciting new opportunities for social science research will be afforded by new administrative data resources, but these are currently under appreciated by the research community. The central aim of this paper is to discuss the challenges associated with administrative data. We emphasise that it is critical for researchers to carefully consider how administrative data has been produced. We conclude that administrative datasets have the potential to contribute to the development of high-quality and impactful social science research, and should not be overlooked in the emerging field of big data."

A methodology is developed for selection of both training parameters and data sets for the training phase. A new technique is also developed to accelerate the learning phase. To benchmark the network, the results are compared to those obtained using three other algorithms: a statistical contextual technique, a supervised piecewise linear classifier, and an unsupervised multispectral clustering algorithm. All three techniques were applied to simulated and real satellite imagery. Results from the classification of both Monte Carlo simulation and real imagery are summarized."
business,"This book has its origins in a meeting of scientists, social scientists, policy makers and political activists held in Malaysia in 1994, and which was attended by the author, who is Reader in Biology at the Open University in the UK. In the author's own words, she learned at the meeting how the dominant reductionist scientific world-view of the West was destroying the earth, creating poverty and suffering for vast numbers of people. The book argues that genetic engineering is bad science working together with big business for quick profit, against the public good, against public will and aspirations, against the moral values of society and the world community. The author advocates the imposition of an immediate moratorium on further releases and marketing of genetically engineered products, pending a public inquiry into the hazards and risks of genetic engineering biotechnology that takes into account scientific findings and their social and moral implications. In the course of developing its theme, the book ranges from criticism of Mendelism, neo-Darwinism and basic quantitative genetics theory, to embryo cloning and transgenesis. The text should be accessible to the informed general reader."
social science,"Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf South at the end of August 2005, devastating lives and raising questions about how race and class influence human, as well as institutional, responses to disaster. This study uses survey data collected from over 1200 Hurricane Katrina survivors to examine these influences on a wide array of responses, ranging from evacuation timing and emotional support to housing and employment situations and plans to return to pre-storm communities. Results reveal strong racial and class differences, indicating that neither of these dimensions can be reduced to the other when seeking to understand responses by survivors themselves. This intersection renders low-income black home owners from New Orleans those most in need of targeted assistance as residents work to put themselves and the region back together.

science,"In this paper, we employ probabilistic neural network (PNN) with image and data processing techniques to implement a general purpose automated leaf recognition for plant classification. 12 leaf features are extracted and orthogonalized into 5 principal variables which consist the input vector of the PNN. The PNN is trained by 1800 leaves to classify 32 kinds of plants with an accuracy greater than 90%. Compared with other approaches, our algorithm is an accurate artificial intelligence approach which is fast in execution and easy in implementation."
social science,"In this paper we use new data on Danish monozygotic (MZ) twins to analyze the effect of cultural capital on educational success. We report three main findings. First, cultural capital has a positive direct effect on the likelihood of completing the college-bound track in Danish secondary education. Second, cultural capital leads teachers to form upwardly biased perceptions of children's academic ability, but only when their exposure to children's cultural capital is brief (as in oral and written exams) rather than long (as in grades awarded at the end of the school year). Third, we find that the positive direct effect of cultural capital on educational success is higher for children from high-socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds than for those from low-SES backgrounds. This result suggests that high-SES children are more likely to be in schooling contexts that enable them to convert cultural capital into educational success."
science,"Methods are presented for adaptively generating wavelet templates for signal representation and classification using neural networks. Different network structures and energy functions are necessary and are given for representation and classification. The idea is introduced of a ""super-wavelet,"" a linear combination of wavelets that itself is treated as a wavelet. The super-wavelet allows the shape of the wavelet to adapt to a particular problem, which goes beyond adapting parameters of a fixed-shape wavelet. Simulations are given for 1-D signals, with the concepts extendable to imagery. Ideas are discussed for applying the concepts in the paper to phoneme and speaker recognition"
social science,"Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality, laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual attitudes may depend on a nation’s cultural context. In this study, we merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality. Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

"
science,"In this paper, a prototype wavelet-based neural-network classifier for recognizing power-quality disturbances is implemented and tested under various transient events. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique is integrated with the probabilistic neural-network (PNN) model to construct the classifier. First, the multiresolution-analysis technique of DWT and the Parseval's theorem are employed to extract the energy distribution features of the distorted signal at different resolution levels. Then, the PNN classifies these extracted features to identify the disturbance type according to the transient duration and the energy features. Since the proposed methodology can reduce a great quantity of the distorted signal features without losing its original property, less memory space and computing time are required. Various transient events tested, such as momentary interruption, capacitor switching, voltage sag/swell, harmonic distortion, and flicker show that the classifier can detect and classify different power disturbance types efficiently."
social science,"Workplace diversity policies are more effective when they are supported by managers and workers, but there is little direct evidence on how people feel about these policies or why they hold certain opinions. In this study, we analyze data from a survey experiment designed to assess public opinion about a range of workplace diversity policies. We examine how support for these policies among employed respondents varies by race, gender, and by the targeted population (i.e. whether the policies aim to improve the workplace representation of women or racial minorities). Using OLS regression models to analyze a diverse sample of employed persons participating in the survey, we find that women, blacks, and Latina/os are more supportive of diversity policies than men and whites, and a substantial portion of these gender/race differences can be explained by group-differences in the belief that discrimination causes inequality. In addition, we find that respondents report lower levels of support for workplace policies when these policies are framed as a mechanism to increase diversity than when they are framed as being needed to address discrimination or if no justification is given for the policy. Our findings highlight the role of inequality beliefs in shaping worker support for diversity policies, suggesting directions for future research on how such beliefs are developed."
science,"Channel sensing and spectrum allocation has long been of interest as a prospective addition to cognitive radios for wireless communications systems occupying license-free bands. Conventional approaches to cyclic spectral analysis have been proposed as a method for classifying signals for applications where the carrier frequency and bandwidths are unknown, but is, however, computationally complex and requires a significant amount of observation time for adequate performance. Neural networks have been used for signal classification, but only for situations where the baseband signal is present. By combining these techniques a more efficient and reliable classifier can be developed where a significant amount of processing is performed offline, thus reducing online computation. In this paper we take a renewed look at signal classification using spectral coherence and neural networks, the performance of which is characterized by Monte Carlo simulations"
social science,"This paper tests two competing explanations of differences in returns to cultural capital across schooling environments: Cultural reproduction (cultural capital yields a higher returns in high-achieving environments than in low-achieving ones) and cultural mobility (cultural capital yields higher returns in low-achieving environments). Using multilevel mixture models, empirical results from analyses based on PISA data from three countries (Canada, Germany, and Sweden) show that returns to cultural capital tend to be higher in low-achieving schooling environments than in high-achieving ones. These results principally support the cultural mobility explanation and suggest that research should pay explicit attention to the institutional contexts in which cultural capital is converted into educational success."
science,"In this paper, an adequate set of input features is selected for functional expansion genetically for the purpose of solving the problem of classification in data mining using functional link neural network. The proposed method named as HFLNN aims to choose an optimal subset of input features by eliminating features with little or no predictive information and designs a more compact classifier. With an adequate set of basis functions, HFLNN overcomes the non-linearity of problems, which is a common phenomenon in single layer neural networks. The properties like simplicity of the architecture (i.e., no hidden layer) and the low computational complexity of the network (i.e., less number of weights to be learned) encourage us to use it in classification task of data mining. We present a mathematical analysis of the stability and convergence of the proposed method. Further the issue of statistical tests for comparison of algorithms on multiple datasets, which is even more essential in data mining studies, has been all but ignored. In this paper, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe, robust and non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of the HFLNN with functional link neural network (FLNN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) classifiers over multiple datasets by an extensive set of simulation studies."
social science,"Anti-immigration attitudes and its origins have been investigated quite extensively. Research that focuses on the evolution of attitudes toward immigration, however, is far more scarce. In this paper, we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) to study the trend of anti-immigration attitudes between 2002 and 2007 in 17 European countries. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the critical legitimacy for comparing latent variable means over countries and time. A Multiple-Group Multiple Indicator Structural Equation Modeling (MGSEM) approach is used to test the cross-country and cross-time equivalence of the variables under study. In a second step, we try to offer an explanation for the observed trends using a dynamic version of group conflict theory. The country-specific evolutions in attitudes toward immigration are shown to coincide with national context factors, such as immigration flows and changes in unemployment rates."
science,"This paper investigates the credit scoring accuracy of five neural network models: multilayer perceptron, mixture-of-experts, radial basis function, learning vector quantization, and fuzzy adaptive resonance. The neural network credit scoring models are tested using 10-fold crossvalidation with two real world data sets. Results are benchmarked against more traditional methods under consideration for commercial applications including linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, k nearest neighbor, kernel density estimation, and decision trees. Results demonstrate that the multilayer perceptron may not be the most accurate neural network model, and that both the mixture-of-experts and radial basis function neural network models should be considered for credit scoring applications. Logistic regression is found to be the most accurate of the traditional methods."
social science,"Does ethnic diversity increase or reduce white threat perceptions? Meta-analyses help orient a field and communicate findings to policymakers. We report the results of a meta-analysis of studies measuring the relationship between ethnic context and both opposition to immigration and support for anti-immigration parties. Our analysis attempts to be exhaustive, and is based on 171 post-1995 studies averaging 25,000 observations each, a knowledge base of over 4 million data points. We find a linear association between ethnic change and elevated threat. However, for diversity levels, the relationship between ethnic context and threat is nonlinear. This takes the form of a 'wave', with higher diversity predicting threat responses at the smallest and largest scales, whereas in units of 5000–10,000 people (such as tracts or neighbourhoods), diversity is associated with reduced threat."
science,"In 2010, after many years of stagnation, the MNIST handwriting recognition benchmark record dropped from 0.40% error rate to 0.35%. Here we report 0.27% for a committee of seven deep CNNs trained on graphics cards, narrowing the gap to human performance. We also apply the same architecture to NIST SD 19, a more challenging dataset including lower and upper case letters. A committee of seven CNNs obtains the best results published so far for both NIST digits and NIST letters. The robustness of our method is verified by analyzing 78125 different 7-net committees."
social science,"The neighbourhood environment has repeatedly proven to be a relevant context for central aspects of individuals’ lives, such as educational attainment. The conventional approach of measuring neighbourhood characteristics within disjunct geographical units fixed at a particular scale is less suitable for representing the characteristics of individual action spaces in everyday activities and for detecting scale-dependent relationships. We, therefore, adapted an ego-centred context approach by aggregating contextual characteristics within (approximately) circular areas around individual respondents’ places of residence (ego-hoods). We also used an analytical framework that considers the quality of hierarchical context effects. This allowed us to derive conclusions about the spatial reference of micro-level mechanisms from the scale of context effects observed as a macro–micro relationship. We linked contextual indicators to individual-level data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Comparing ego-hoods of different ranges, we confirmed the expectation of distance decay in the relevance of neighbours for individual educational aspirations."
